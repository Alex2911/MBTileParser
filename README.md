**Look Ma, no low-level codee!**

MBTileParser began as a small library that allows you to parse TMX files and then display them  using pure UIKit. (You don't need to learn OpenGL and you don't have to use a game engine. ) Now, MBTileParser is more of a game engine, in that it supports loading TMX files, cocos2d spritesheets created with TexturePacker, and more. Loaded sprites can be displayed onscreen and even animated. Work is in progress to allow sprites to move onscreen via emulated joystick input.

**How It Works**

Under the hood, MBTileParser is a work in progress, but right now, it can load TMX files and displays them.

**A word on the TMX format**

The TMX file format is used by Tiled, a tool which helps you make world maps for games. (You can download Tiled from the web at http://mapeditor.org)

The TMX format is explained in detail on the [tiled GitHub repository wiki](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format).
